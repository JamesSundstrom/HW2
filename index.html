        <b>Instructions:</b> In the Tree Game, there are two players: a
        firefighter and a pyromaniac. The two of them walk together around a
        circular path lined with trees, some of which are on fire. The
        firefighter's goal is to put out all the fires, while the pyromaniac's
        goal is to prevent the firefighter from doing that.
      </p>
      <p>
        The above game allows you to play the Tree Game as a two-player game,
        as a one-player game against the computer, or in demonstration mode 
        (watching two computer players). When you start a new game, a random 
        starting position is generated.
      </p>
      <p><b>Settings:</b> The Settings menu allows you to adjust several settings:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Min/Max Trees</b>: How many trees are there in a game? (The minimum
        must be at least three, and the maximum must be at most twelve.)</li>
        <li><b>Threefold repetition</b>: In the baseline version of the game, there is 
          no way for the pyromaniac to win, other than the firefighter giving up. 
          If this setting is changed to "Yes," then the pyromaniac wins if the game is 
          in the same position three times. (Note that two positions count as the
          same if one is a rotation of the other.)
        </li>
        <li><b>Difficulty</b>: Computer player difficulty: 0 is random play, and 10
        is perfect play. (The only exception is that on any difficulty level, a 
        computer-controlled firefighter will take a trivial win if available, i.e.,
        if the firefighter can win before the pyromaniac gets another turn.)</li>
      </ul>

            The idea of the game has been around for a while. The particular
            description in terms of a firefighter and a pyromaniac is from
